# Personalized Learning Plan: Improving Risk Assessment

## Understanding Your Regulation Gap

You're facing challenges with **assessing risks** in your work. This is a common cognitive gap that affects your ability to identify what's most important to focus on next and how to prioritize your efforts effectively.

Based on the analysis of your work, you tend to [LLM will insert specific patterns observed in the student's approach to risks].

## Understanding Risk in Design Research

Risk exists when variables in your causal model represent:
* **Unmet conditions**: Things you know are needed but haven't achieved (e.g., not knowing the root cause of user needs, or creating solutions users don't value)
* **Unknown conditions**: Things you're uncertain about (e.g., being unsure about your assumptions, not knowing if users will value your solution)

The goal of risk assessment is to identify these gaps and prioritize addressing the ones most critical to project success.

## Reflection on Recent Learning

Take time to document what you've learned recently:

* **New Insights**: What new things did you learn last week about your problem, users, designs, etc.?
* **Changed Understanding**: How has your understanding evolved from previous weeks?
* **Validated Assumptions**: Which of your assumptions have you confirmed?
* **Invalidated Assumptions**: Which assumptions have you discovered were incorrect?

## Identifying Gaps in Your Understanding

1. Map your current causal model and identify **specific unknown or unmet conditions**:
   * What root causes are you still unsure about?
   * Which user needs remain unvalidated?
   * What aspects of your solution haven't been tested with users?
   * What connections in your causal model are based on assumptions rather than evidence?

2. For each gap identified, explain **why it's a risk**:
   * How could this unknown/unmet condition affect project outcomes?
   * What might happen if your assumption about this variable is wrong?
   * How might this gap create misalignment between your solution and user needs?

3. **Hint**: Review your research canvas - have you answered all the scaffolding questions for each prompt?

## Prioritizing Risks for Your Next Sprint

1. Identify the **1-2 highest priority risks** to address next:
   * Risk 1: [Description]
   * Risk 2: [Description]

2. For each prioritized risk, explain:
   * Why this risk takes precedence over others
   * What specific research activities will help address this risk
   * What evidence would indicate you've sufficiently addressed it

## Practice Exercises for This Week

1. **Causal Model Risk Map**: Create a visual map of your project's causal model. Highlight variables that represent unknown or unmet conditions, and indicate the level of risk each presents.

2. **Assumption Testing Plan**: For your top 3 risks:
   * List the key assumptions underlying each risk
   * Design a specific test for each assumption
   * Define what evidence would confirm or refute each assumption

3. **Pre-Mortem Analysis**: Imagine your project has failed specifically because of unaddressed risks in your causal model. Write a brief "post-mortem" describing:
   * Which unmet/unknown conditions led to failure
   * What signals you missed that could have highlighted these risks
   * How you could have better assessed and addressed these risks

## Reflection Prompts

* What patterns do you notice in the types of unknown/unmet conditions you tend to overlook?
* How might you integrate risk assessment more systematically into your research process?
* What barriers prevent you from thoroughly assessing risks before moving forward?
* When have you successfully identified and addressed a significant risk? What approach did you use?
