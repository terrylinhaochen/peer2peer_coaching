It's not a full story\nPlan: [self-work] look over my comments in the narrative doc you share\n[self-work] let's focus on the Alex example and really try to address the risks of lacking casual structure in the story telling and lacking specifics of examples. I would go back to having a rep[story representation that includes both casual links among the  parts (maybe labeling edges, \"this affects that because....\"), AND explicit boxes for SPECIFIC examples so that even when you have an example, you get yourself to work on being even more specific there (down to something that is an actual, tangible thing!! not just an idea (e.g., be more creative, explore more options -- creative how? what options?))\n[plan] I would suggest focusing on the Alex example than on CSTs. But if you are really worried about CSTs, you can do a slice of that --- by thinking about why CSTs may struggle to help Alex. But even if you do that, stick with the Alex example!! If you could get that example really good, I think you will really get it.",
